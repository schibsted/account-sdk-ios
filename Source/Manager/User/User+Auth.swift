         Suppose that you have a mobile native login UI,

         The URL returned by this method should be used to navigate the web view,
         which will then redirect to your destination given "redirectURL".
         After that happens you'll have a session cookie for the current user set up in the web view.
         That makes it possible to navigate to personalised or protected web pages in the logged in state.
