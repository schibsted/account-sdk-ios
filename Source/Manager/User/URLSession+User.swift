/**
 The URLSession is exactly the same as the foundation API one, but it has been modified to act on a specific `User` object instead and
 to automatically manage OAuth related session lifetimes and renewals.

 If you want to make requests that contain the internal user access tokens, you should create a session object with one of the provided
 extension initializers. Following this, you may use the URLSession as you would any other session, the only difference is that all
 requests send with this session will contain a Authorization header with a bearer access token inside it.

 ### Automatic refreshing

 The URLSession sets a custom URLProtocol object internally that is used to managed all requests created with this session. Before
 forwarding the results of a request back to you, the protocol implementation checks to make sure that the HTTP status code was NOT
 a 401. If it ever received a 401, it tries to refresh the user tokens internally. It does this by either pausing or stopping all
 other requests in flight or in queue, and then either resuming them all after a successful refresh of the tokens, or cancelling
 them all otherwise.

 - Note: Your servers MUST validate the accesstoken that is issued with your requets with the
 [token introspection](https://techdocs.login.schibsted.com/oauth/introspect/) endpoint.

 ### Errors

 1. `ClientError.userRefreshFailed`
 1. `ClientError.invalidUser`

 If there's a refresh failure, then the `User` object that is associated with this `URLSession` object is logged out, as there is no
 way to recover short of logging the user back in again.
