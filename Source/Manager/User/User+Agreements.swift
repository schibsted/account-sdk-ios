         Since new terms and conditions may be issued at any time, you should call this method at the app's startup to check that the logged in user (if any)
         you have obtained from an instance of `IdentityManager` has accepted the latest terms. If the result provided from the completion callback is `false`,
         you should then obtain the latest terms by calling `IdentityManager.fetchTerms(:)` and present a screen where the user can review and accept the
         updated terms.

         The recommended way of presenting the terms acceptance screen is by using the provided UI flows, thus by calling`IdentityUI.presentTerms(for:from:)`.
         If you are using the headless approach instead, you should then present your own UI and manually call `accept(:)`, if the user accepted the new terms,
         or `User.logout()`, if the user rejected them.
